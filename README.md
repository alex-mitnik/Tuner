# Tuner
This repository will document the code to implement the fingerboard tuner display designed in BME 162.
Its design is intended to be intuitive for Deaf and Hard of Hearing children who are violin beginners.
A report of the design process, including rationale, goals, UI prototypes, and test results is available at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v7GUcd96wlAWabAxNnH3s3XQJ4X6Xfjd/view
